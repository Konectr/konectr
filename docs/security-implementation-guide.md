# Konectr Security Implementation Guide - Non-Technical Founder

## User Research Security Insights

### Key Safety Concerns Identified:
1. **Profile Verification** - Users want to know they're meeting real people
2. **Women-Only Options** - Female users need safe spaces 
3. **Anti-Flaking Measures** - Users frustrated with no-shows

```

**Step 2: Consent Management**
```

```

**Step 3: User Rights Implementation**
```

## 4. Safe Data Storage Setup

### Recommended No-Code Stack

#### Primary Database: Supabase (Recommended)
**Why Supabase for Konectr:**
✅ Built-in security (Row Level Security)
✅ Real-time features (for matching)
✅ Authentication included
✅ GDPR/PDPA compliant
✅ Encryption at rest

**Setup Steps (45 minutes):**
1. **Create Account**: supabase.com
2. **Create Project**: "konectr-production"
3. **Enable Security Features**:
   ```
   Row Level Security: ON
   API Key Restrictions: ON
   Audit Logging: ON
   Backup Encryption: ON
   ```

4. **Create Secure Tables**:
   ```sql
   -- This will be done by your developer
   -- But you should understand the structure:
   
   waitlist_users:
   ├── id (encrypted)
   ├── email (encrypted)
   ├── phone (encrypted) 
   ├── gender
   ├── area (general only)
   ├── age_range
   ├── consent_data
   └── created_at
   ```

#### Alternative: Airtable (Simpler but less secure)
**If Supabase feels too technical:**
- **Airtable Pro**: $20/month
- **Built-in encryption**
- **GDPR compliance features**
- **Easy data export**
- **⚠️ Note**: Less secure than Supabase for sensitive data

### Data Security Checklist

```
✅ Only you have admin access initially
✅ Use strong passwords + 2FA everywhere
✅ Regular access audits
✅ Separate staging/production environments
```

#### Backup & Recovery
```
✅ Daily automated backups
